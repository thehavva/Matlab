% The location of a point in a Cartesian plane can be expressed in either the rectangular
% coordinates (x, y) or the polar coordinates (r, u).
% Write two functions rect2polar and polar2rect that convert coordinates from
% rectangular to polar form, and vice versa, where the angle u is expressed in degrees.

[a,b]= rect2polar(4,3);
[x, y] = polar2rect(5,36.8699);
