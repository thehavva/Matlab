**What is MATLAB?**<br/>
MATLAB (matrix laboratory) is a multi-paradigm numerical computing software and fourth generation programming language. MATLAB, a proprietary programming language, is developed by MathWorks. MATLAB allows the user to manipulate matrix, plot functions and data, implement algorithms, create user interfaces, and interface with programs written in other languages ​​such as C, C++, Java, and Fortran.

Although MATLAB is primarily intended for numerical processing, it uses the MuPAD symbolic engine, which can optionally perform symbolic computation. The add-on package adds Simulink, graphical multi-domain simulation and model-based design for dynamic and embedded systems.

In 2004, the number of MATLAB academic and industrial users was around one million.[19] MATLAB users come from various fields such as engineering, science, and economics. MATLAB is widely used in academic and research institutions as well as in industrial enterprises.

*Thanks to the Computer tools for electrical engineering course, MATLAB/SIMULINK, MULTISIM and
I am learning LABVIEW tools. I programmed the end-of-unit questions based on the 'Essential of MATLAB Programming' book that I followed throughout this course. I will also share our LAB sheets and upload my own answers. I hope it will be useful for everyone.*
